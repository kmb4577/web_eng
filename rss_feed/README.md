Each Feed group is categorized by the following general categories:
US News, World News, Sports, Weather, and Technology

When a user selects the button to add a specific news feed within a general category then that feed will present itself in its own panel in the users feed section.

If the user does not log out then each time they visit the url in the browser that they are using then it will bring them to their main page and they will not have to login because they will already be logged in.

If the user logs out then the next time they visit the sites page then they will have to login again.

Tha current time is displayed at the top of the page with the last login time presented each time that a user logs out and logs back in.

rssfeed.html & rssexample.html are currently NOT in use
